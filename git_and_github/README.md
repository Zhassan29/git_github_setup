## Github setup
Generate ssh key
```doctest
cd /c/Users/zak
cd .ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "(your_email")
```
Add SSH public key to Github account. read SSH key by copying the public key

Create a repository on GitHub and follow the steps to connect to Pycharm
```doctest
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin "git@github:[username]/[repository].git"
git push -u origin main
```
#### Git & Github
- add changes to our Git-hub repo -the changes that we made on localhost

-``git add filenames`` or ``git add .`` , means push everything from current location
- ``git commit -m "new markdown guide added"``
- now lets send this new data to Github
- ``git push -u origin main``
- ``git status``
- add ``gitignore`` then ``add all dependencies in this file to ensure not pushed``

```bash
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
